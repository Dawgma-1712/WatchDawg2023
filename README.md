# Why WatchDawg (or Features)

## An All in One System.

The WatchDawg scouting system allows users to:
* Pit Scout for information on other team's robots
* Match Scout
* Automatically Analyze Other Teams and Robots During Matches

## An Offline System.

The WatchDawg scouting system is entirely offline!

WatchDawg uses QR codes to transmit data without Wi-Fi. These QR codes can also be saved to the Amazon Fire's Photos for bulk inputs. (such as pit scouting)

## An Easy To Use System.

The WatchDawg system is very intutitive, both on the App side and the Microsoft Excel side.

It is integrated with Microsoft Excel and provides automatic match and robot analysis when given data.
