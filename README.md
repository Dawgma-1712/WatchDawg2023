# WatchDawg 2023
WatchDawg is a scouting system developed by Team 1712 Dawgma designed to work in venues without cell connection. 

Here's our [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy0VXm0XURE) on how to use the Pit Scouting portion of the WatchDawg App. <!--maybe split into 2 parts like our videos?-->

Here's our [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftOPcMmmr5I) on how to use the Match Scouting portion of the WatchDawg App.

# Why WatchDawg (or Features)

## An All in One System.

The WatchDawg scouting system allows users to: <!--IDK maybe change this-->
* Pit Scout for information on other team's robots <!--Better to use 1/2/3 or dots?-->
* Match Scout <!-- Or maybe not use a list because we have 2 things --> <!--Scratch that we're good-->
* Automatically Analyze Other Teams and Robots During Matches

## An Offline System.

The WatchDawg scouting system is entirely offline, so no worries if you forget about loading your scouting system right before a competition!

In addition, no worries if you accidentally close a tab on your device -- WatchDawg will still be there when you come back.

WatchDawg uses QR codes to transmit data without Wi-Fi. These QR codes can also be saved to the Amazon Fire's Photos for bulk inputs. (such as pit scouting)

## An Easy To Use System.

The WatchDawg system is very intutitive, both on the App side and the Microsoft Excel side. <!-- reword obviously -->

It is integrated with excel and provides automatic match and robot analysis when given data, and the portability of the app allows scouters to be spread out for better viewing.

<!--More stuff to note
not a web page (not a big deal but what if oops i closed the web page)
Excel Integration and Automatic Match Analysis check
Fully Offline check?
Ease of use/Portability check
App + Excel sheet check?

# Quick Start <!--Git has an internal wiki system so we could use that?-->

You should have the required systems (found below, or [here](https://github.com/Dawgma-1712/WatchDawg2023#system-requirements)) before proceeding.

1. Download the Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet found on Git. It contains macros for the automated analysis.
2. Download the app if you haven't already (again, [here](https://www.amazon.com/Dawgma-Robotics-WatchDawg/dp/B09VMZZ6FL/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Z8C9C9DSI7YN&keywords=watchdawg&qid=1676407384&s=mobile-apps&sprefix=watchdawg%2Cmobile-apps%2C167&sr=1-1) for the Amazon Fire Store link, or the Git release)
3. Download the instruction manual (found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o54JGi-gihyFXh7UFRre76viZELWCKad/view?usp=sharing))
