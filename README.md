# WatchDawg 2023
WatchDawg is a scouting system developed by Team 1712 Dawgma designed to work in venues without cell connection. 

Here's our [tutorial (links to google for now)](google.com) on how to use WatchDawg <!--maybe split into 2 parts like our videos?-->

<!--Like so: Here's our [tutorial](google.com) for the excel portion of WatchDawg-->

# Why WatchDawg (or Features)

## An All in One System.

The WatchDawg scouting system allows users to: <!--IDK maybe change this-->
* Pit Scout for information on other team's robots <!--Better to use 1/2/3 or dots?-->
* Match Scout <!-- Or maybe not use a list because we have 2 things -->
* Automatically Analyze Other Teams and Robots During Live Matches

## An Offline System.

The WatchDawg scouting system is entirely offline, so no worries if you forget about your scouting system right before a competition!

## An Easy To Use System.

The watchdawg system is very intutitive <!-- reword obviously -->
Integrated with excel and provides automatic match and robot analysis
Portability of the app allows scouters to be spread out for better viewing

<!--More stuff to note

# Quick Start <!--Git has an internal wiki system so we could use that?-->

[Here](google.com)'s the quick start guide for WatchDawg

<!-- Or if we use the wiki system: We have an in depth wiki for WatchDawg [here](linklinklinkyougetit)-->

# Future Goals

- [ ] Port to other android systems, not just the Amazon Fire 7
- [ ] Goal 2
- [ ] Crosschecking with the Blue Alliance Database

<!--Any other goals-->

# System Requirements
* Amazon Fire 7 tablets (tested, although any android device should techincally be able to run it)
* A Computer with Excel 
* The app downloaded either through android studio using the [github release (again, links to google for now)](google.com) or the amazon [fire store](https://www.amazon.com/Dawgma-Robotics-WatchDawg/dp/B09VMZZ6FL/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Z8C9C9DSI7YN&keywords=watchdawg&qid=1676407384&s=mobile-apps&sprefix=watchdawg%2Cmobile-apps%2C167&sr=1-1)
